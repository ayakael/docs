# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on openSUSE

.NET is supported on openSUSE. This article describes how to install .NET on openSUSE.

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

## Supported distributions

There are two types of supported releases, Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Standard Term Support (STS). The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for 3 years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases on openSUSE 15. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of openSUSE is no longer supported.

- ✔️ indicates that the version of openSUSE or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of openSUSE or .NET isn't supported on that Alpine release.
- When both a version of Alpine and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.

| openSUSE  | .NET 6 (LTS) | .NET 7 (STS) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| ✔️ 15      | ✔️ 6.0        | ✔️ 7.0        |

## Troubleshoot the package manager

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using the package manager to install .NET.

### Unable to find package

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

### Failed to fetch

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm](includes/package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm.md)]

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- krb5
- libicu
- libopenssl1_0_0

If the target runtime environment's OpenSSL version is 1.1 or newer, you'll need to install **compat-openssl10**.

For more information about the dependencies, see [Self-contained Linux apps](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md).

For .NET apps that use the *System.Drawing.Common* assembly, you'll also need the following dependency:

- [libgdiplus (version 6.0.1 or later)](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/libgdiplus/)

  > [!WARNING]
  > You can install a recent version of *libgdiplus* by adding the Mono repository to your system. For more information, see <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/>.
